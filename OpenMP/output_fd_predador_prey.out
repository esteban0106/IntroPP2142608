FD_PREDATOR_PREY
  C version

  A finite difference approximate solution of a pair
  of ordinary differential equations for a population
  of predators and prey.

  The exact solution shows wave behavior, with a fixed
  period and amplitude.  The finite difference approximation
  can provide a good estimate for this behavior if the stepsize
  DT is small enough.
